The problem is the shortage of metallic resources needed for growing population. With ever growing metal dependance, the shortage is only widening as this is a fundamentally important tool for the civilization.

2.
Entire humanity is bound to be affected by this. We need 10^30 kg of metal to afford upcoming NASA's artemis operations alone. With the massive demand and weakening supply, there are tougher times ahead if this problem isnt addressed soon.

The current solution to mining rare metals is through the refining process for more conventional metals where they can be isolated and acquired.
a. Currently this is the only method of obtaining rare metals in bulk quantities.
b. All currently known methods of obtaining these metals is through conventional mining.
c. This method is unsustainable in the long term as there is as yields are not guaranteed and this process is very wasteful and energy intensive, and as time goes on and the mineable quantity of these metals decrease it will become less and less economical.
However, we can with reasonable certainity determine the elemental composition of metals in asteroids and as such can acquire meaningful quantities of rare metals, and if done correctly this venture could even be profitable.
